# Write a Readme

This Repl has code for an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript slideshow (it's probably familiar from your slideshow project).

Your job is to write a Readme file so that someone else could understand what this code is, what it's for, and how to use it.

## Instructions

Create a file called `Readme.md` using the + button in the Files tab.

In the Readme, write a description of what the code is, what it's for, and how to use it. Include:

* a title
* an overview of what the project is
* instructions on how to use it
* a description of how the code works

It's nice to organize the code into sections with subtitles. In markdown, headings are lines that start with some number of `#`.

An h1 would be written:

```
# My Title
```

An h2 would be written:

```
## How to use it
```

and so on.

## Example Readmes

Here's some example projects on Github. Click to their projects and scan their Readme's to see what kinds of sections are typically included in a Readme file.

As you check them out, ask yourself:

- What did you do differently?
- What did they include that you didn’t?
- What did you include that they didn’t?
